	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Self-reported counts of intentional abortions in demographic surveys are significantly lower than the actual counts. To estimate the extent of misreporting, previous research has required either a gold standard or a validation sample. However, in most cases, a gold standard or a validation sample is not available.
{OBJECTIVE} Our main intention here is to show that a researcher has an alternative tool to estimate the extent of underreporting in a given dataset, particularly when neither a valid gold standard nor a validation sample is available.
{METHODS} We adopt a binomial-thinned zero-inflated Poisson model and apply it to a sample dataset, the National Survey of Family Growth ({NSFG}), for which an alternative estimate of the average reporting rate (38\%) is available. We show how this model could be used to estimate the reporting probabilities of intentional abortions by each individual in addition to the overall average reporting rate.
{RESULTS} Our model estimates the average reporting rate in the {NSFG} during 2006‒2013 as 35.3\% ({SE} 8.2\%). Individual reporting probabilities vary significantly.
{CONCLUSIONS} Our estimate of the average reporting rate of the dataset used is qualitatively and statistically similar to the available alternative estimate.},

The Conway–Maxwell–Poisson ({COM}-Poisson) distribution has demonstrated itself as a viable alternative for real count data that express data over- or under-dispersion, and thus the {COM}-Poisson regression can flexibly model associations involving a discrete count response variable and covariates. This work overviews the ongoing developmental knowledge and advancement of {COM}-Poisson regression, introducing the reader to the underlying model (and its considered reparametrizations) and related regression constructs, including zero-inflated models, and longitudinal studies. This manuscript further introduces readers to associated computing tools available to perform {COM}-Poisson and related regressions.

	abstract = {In this paper we consider regression models for count data allowing for overdispersion in a Bayesian framework. We account for unobserved heterogeneity in the data in two ways. On the one hand, we consider more flexible models than a common Poisson model allowing for overdispersion in different ways. In particular, the negative binomial and the generalized Poisson ({GP}) distribution are addressed where overdispersion is modelled by an additional model parameter. Further, zero-inflated models in which overdispersion is assumed to be caused by an excessive number of zeros are discussed. On the other hand, extra spatial variability in the data is taken into account by adding correlated spatial random effects to the models. This approach allows for an underlying spatial dependency structure which is modelled using a conditional autoregressive prior based on Pettitt et al. in Stat Comput 12(4):353–367, (2002). In an application the presented models are used to analyse the number of invasive meningococcal disease cases in Germany in the year 2004. Models are compared according to the deviance information criterion ({DIC}) suggested by Spiegelhalter et al. in J R Stat Soc B64(4):583–640, (2002) and using proper scoring rules, see for example Gneiting and Raftery in Technical Report no. 463, University of Washington, (2004). We observe a rather high degree of overdispersion in the data which is captured best by the {GP} model when spatial effects are neglected. While the addition of spatial effects to the models allowing for overdispersion gives no or only little improvement, spatial Poisson models with spatially correlated or uncorrelated random effects are to be preferred over all other models according to the considered criteria.},

	abstract = {Count data with complex features arise in many disciplines, including ecology, agriculture, criminology, medicine, and public health. Zero inflation, spatial dependence, and non-equidispersion are common features in count data. There are two classes of models that allow for these features -- he mode-parameterized Conway--Maxwell--Poisson ({COMP}) distribution and the generalized Poisson model. However both require the use of either constraints on the parameter space or a parameterization that leads to challenges in interpretability. We propose a spatial mean-parameterized {COMP} model that retains the flexibility of these models while resolving the above issues. We use a Bayesian spatial filtering approach in order to efficiently handle high-dimensional spatial data and we use reversible-jump {MCMC} to automatically choose the basis vectors for spatial filtering. The {COMP} distribution poses two additional computational challenges -- an intractable normalizing function in the likelihood and no closed-form expression for the mean. We propose a fast computational approach that addresses these challenges by, respectively, introducing an efficient auxiliary variable algorithm and pre-computing key approximations for fast likelihood evaluation. We illustrate the application of our methodology to simulated and real datasets, including Texas {HPV}-cancer data and {US} vaccine refusal data.},

The distribution models considered in this study include the binomial ({BN}), the beta- binomial ({BB}), the multiplicative binomial ({MBM}), the Com-Poisson binomial ({CPB}) and the double binomial ({DBM}) models. Applications of these models to several well known data sets exhibiting under-dispersion and over-dispersion were considered in this paper. We applied these models to two frequency data sets and two data sets with covariates that have been variously analysed in the literature. The first relates to the Portuguese version of Duke Religiosity Index in a sample of 273 (202 women, 71 Male) postgraduate students of the faculty of Medicine of University of Sao Paulo. The second set that employs the Generalize Linear Model ({GLM}) is the correlated binary data which studies the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin chemoteraphy on the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood. In the first data set, we have a single
covariate, Sex (0,1) and two covariates in the second data set (dose and time).

Our results indicate that all the models considered here (excluding the binomial) behave reasonably well in modeling over-dispersed binary data with or without covariates, although both the multiplicative binomial and the double binomial models slightly behave better for these specific data sets. While this result may not be necessarily generalized to other variety of over and under-dispersed data, we would however, encourage the investigation of all possible models so that the right applicable model can be employed for a given data set under consideration.

Double exponential families allow the introduction of a second parameter that controls variance independently of the mean. Double families are used as constituent distributions in generalized linear regressions, in which both means and variances are allowed to depend on observed covariates. The theory is applied to two examples--a logistic regression and a large two-way contingency table. In such cases the binomial model of variance is often untrustworthy. For example, because genuine random sampling was infeasible, the subjects may have been obtained in clumps so that the statistician should really be using smaller sample sizes. Clumped sampling is just one of many possible causes of overdispersion, a habitual source of concern to users of binomial and Poisson models. This article concerns a class of regression families that allow the statistician to model overdispersion while carrying out the usual regression analyses for the mean as a function of the predictors. Close connections with previous ideas concerning generalized linear models are discussed.},

	abstract = {Poisson regression is a popular tool for modeling count data and is applied in a vast array of applications from the social to the physical sciences and beyond. Real data, however, are often over- or under-dispersed and, thus, not conducive to Poisson regression. We propose a regression model based on the Conway—Maxwell-Poisson ({COM}-Poisson) distribution to address this problem. The {COM}-Poisson regression generalizes the well-known Poisson and logistic regression models, and is suitable for fitting count data with a wide range of dispersion levels. With a {GLM} approach that takes advantage of exponential family properties, we discuss model estimation, inference, diagnostics, and interpretation, and present a test for determining the need for a {COM}-Poisson regression over a standard Poisson regression. We compare the {COM}-Poisson to several alternatives and illustrate its advantages and usefulness using three data sets with varying dispersion.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study are to: (1) examine the applicability of the double Poisson ({DP}) generalized linear model ({GLM}) for analyzing motor vehicle crash data characterized by over- and under-dispersion and (2) compare the performance of the {DP} {GLM} with the Conway–Maxwell–Poisson ({COM}-Poisson) {GLM} in terms of goodness-of-fit and theoretical soundness. The {DP} distribution has seldom been investigated and applied since its first introduction two decades ago. The hurdle for applying the {DP} is related to its normalizing constant (or multiplicative constant) which is not available in closed form. This study proposed a new method to approximate the normalizing constant of the {DP} with high accuracy and reliability. The {DP} {GLM} and {COM}-Poisson {GLM} were developed using two observed over-dispersed datasets and one observed under-dispersed dataset. The modeling results indicate that the {DP} {GLM} with its normalizing constant approximated by the new method can handle crash data characterized by over- and under-dispersion. Its performance is comparable to the {COM}-Poisson {GLM} in terms of goodness-of-fit ({GOF}), although {COM}-Poisson {GLM} provides a slightly better fit. For the over-dispersed data, the {DP} {GLM} performs similar to the {NB} {GLM}. Considering the fact that the {DP} {GLM} can be easily estimated with inexpensive computation and that it is simpler to interpret coefficients, it offers a flexible and efficient alternative for researchers to model count data.},
